# Amazon EKS Custom AMI Build Specification

This repository contains sample scripts and [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates for building Amazon EKS worker nodes. Currently all CloudFormation templates make use of [Amazon EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/) for AMI builds. These templates make use of the [awslabs Amazon EKS AMI Build Specification repository](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami) and the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) specific variant repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-eks-ami-rhel).

## üöÄ Getting started

If you are new to Amazon EKS, we recommend that you follow our [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) chapter in the Amazon EKS User Guide. If you already have a cluster, and you want to launch a node group with your new AMI, see [Launching Amazon EKS Worker Nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html).

## üî¢ Pre-requisites

* AWS Account with permissions to build AMIs using EC2 Image Builder.
* Internet connectivity from EC2 for file downloads OR files stored locally in S3 bucket.

## üóÇÔ∏è Cloning the Github repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-eks-custom-builds.git && cd amazon-eks-custom-builds

```

## üë∑ Building the AMI

Building an EKS worker node is as simple as modifying one of the sample CloudFormation templates to your liking, deploying it your AWS account with your parameter decisions, and executing the resulting [EC2 Image Builder Pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/how-image-builder-works.html).

This could be done using an AWS CLI command using the default parameters defined in the CloudFormation template.
```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-eks-worker-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.yaml

```
